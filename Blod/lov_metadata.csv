The snag faced by the researchers in the current time is the failure of getting relevant results when searching for algorithms in any search engine. AMV is represented as a semantic model and produced OWL file, which can be directly used by anyone interested to create and publish algorithm metadata as a knowledge graph, or to provide metadata service through SPARQL endpoint.

DBA Ontology,dba,['Catalogs'],"The ontology, presented here in a beta version, is based on the analysis of the documentation and descriptive requirements of the Intesa Sanpaolo Historical Archive and is intended to describe the content of historical banking documents and of some of the activities carried out by the bank, particularly in relation to third parties (loans, charity donations, seizures and confiscations, etc.), which involve the initiation of processes or the production of documents. The focal point of the descriptive model is the bank - an entity that initiates different types of processes, whose common feature is that they are structured into various stages/events - and the relationship between the documentation produced and the information it contains. In fact, this ontology is based on information collected from archived documents which describe various processes and activities carried out by banking institutions: the starting point for its construction were the inventories and databases of documentation stored in the Historical Archive which was produced by the various banks that over time were merged into Intesa Sanpaolo. The ontology was created to provide a sufficiently abstract representation and model for describing the processes of various banking activities from which the documentation was produced - from a company's request for financing and its outcome, to the preparation of seizure, confiscation and asset restitution filings, to charitable contributions, just to mention a few examples - reusing models that were already well established and widely used. The structure of the proposed ontology is in fact intended to adapt to the various activities, described in the archive files that a banking institution performs in relation to third parties. The proposed ontology is therefore not an ontology on banking activity in general, but on the relationship between this activity and the documents that are produced. Moreover, its objective is not to describe the documents in the strict sense of the term, for which reference is made to OAD ontology. The purpose of this project is to lay the initial, and fundamental, building blocks for describing the complexity, variety, and breadth of the domain of archiving bank records and the data they contain. Despite having data from different banks relating to different activities and having already made arrangements for the integration of third-party datasets and ontologies, before completing the project we will have to wait for the processing of representations based on other types of documents and banking institutions, including non-Italian ones.",https://w3id.org/dba/ontology/,,,(No license declared),42,https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/dba

rather than `rdfs:domain/range` (which are monomorphic) to prescribe what classes must be applied to each node using a property.

Under the same was ordered the start of the project to open public data and on February 6, 2013 was implemented through the Portalopendata.aragon.es.

Throughout this time there have been numerous works to achieve automation in the publication of information to ensure that third parties can reuse it in the best way. Given the volume of data that begins to exist, within the line of work of automation in information management, all those elements that help in the improvement of thestructuring of informationand thestandardization of the datacontained in the databases are beginning to have a special relevance.

Based on this, within the General Directorate of Electronic Administration and Information Society, the idea arises of generating a set of technical and legal rules that allow to deepen in that standardization and that lead to think in the creation of the Interoperable Information Scheme Of Aragon (E2IA). The E2IA thus emerges as the framework in which the open data and in general the information of the Government of Aragon can begin to be automated in a much more profound way. The E2IA has to have a number of technical, organizational and legal elements that need to be developed.

For this reason, the Technological Institute of Aragon (ITAINNOVA) has been entrusted with carrying out actions consisting in identifying, studying and analyzing current research trends and technological development in relation to ontologies and dictionaries of data interoperability, defining the ontological proposal, performing The necessary tests to validate the ontological proposal and generate the text and web versions of the ontology.",https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl,,,(No license declared),38,https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/ei2a

General User Feedback Ontology (GUFO),gufo,"['General & Upper', 'Events']","The objective of gUFO is to provide a lightweight implementation of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) [1-5] suitable for Semantic Web OWL 2 DL applications. 

Intended users are those implementing UFO-based lightweight ontologies that reuse gUFO by specializing and instantiating its elements.

There are three implications of the use of the term lightweight. First of all, we have employed little expressive means in an effort to retain computational properties for the resulting OWL ontology. Second, we have selected a subset of UFO-A [1, 2] and UFO-B [3] to include here. In particular, there is minimalistic support for UFO-B (only that which is necessary to establish the participation of objects in events and to capture historical dependence between events). Third, a lightweight ontology, differently from a reference ontology, is designed with the purpose of providing an implementation artifact to structure a knowledge base (or knowledge graph). This has driven a number of pragmatic implementation choices which are discussed in comments annotated to the various elements of this implementation. 

The 'g' in gUFO stands for gentle. At the same time, ""gufo"" is the Italian word for ""owl"".

NFDI4Ing Metadata Ontology,m4i,"['Academy', 'Metadata']","Metadata4Ing defines classes and properties or reuses such classes and properties from other ontologies to describe research processes and research data management in NFDI4Ing. 
New concepts and properties are located in the namespace of Metadata4Ing.
Metadata4Ing does not import complete ontologies for the sake of relevance, readability, understandability and usability by and for engineers.
Instead, it tries to make re-use of existing identifiers for classes and properties by re-using all or a relevant subset of the axioms from the original ontology.
These statements have been extracted in different ways, e.g. by using Protégé tools importing an ontology and copying axioms of relevant items to Metadata4Ing or by download from data services or raw files of ontologies and manual copypasting.
In some cases there was a need to extend or modify the original set of statements about an entity, e.g. because labels and definitions were expressed with a different owl:AnnotationProperty than the rest of Metadata4Ing, or because a skos:preflabel or a skos:definition in any of the languages we would like to support was missing.
Any editorial changes on elements from external ontologies are declared in Metadata4Ing by an annotation with skos:editorialNote at item-level.
To get the original set of statements we encourage to visit the original namespace of the respective item.
Metadata4Ing reuses elements from the following ontologies:
- BIBO = Bibliographic Ontology  
- BIRO = Bibliographic Reference Ontology  
- DCAT = Data Catalog

Today, most of the content consumed/produced/published, on the Web is not presented in RDF. 

In the Web of Things, HTTP servers and clients would rather exchange lightweight documents, potentially binary.

SAREF4EHAW (eHealth and Ageing Well) Extension,s4ehaw,['IoT'],"The objective of SAREF4EHAW is to extend SAREF ontology for the eHealth/Ageing-well (EHAW) vertical. Clause 4.1 of the present document shortly introduces a high level view of the envisioned SAREF4EHAW semantic model and modular ontology, with the retained concepts (i.e. classes) and their relations. 
SAREF4EHAW extension has been specified and formalised by investigating EHAW domain related resources, as reported in ETSI TR 103 509, such as: potential stakeholders, standardization initiatives, alliances/associations, European projects, EC directives, existing ontologies, and data repositories. Therefore, SAREF4EHAW modular ontology shall both:
 - Allow the implementation of a limited set of typical EHAW related use cases already identified in ETSI TR 103 509, i.e.
 - Use case 1 ?elderly at home monitoring and support?,
 - Use case 2 ?monitoring and support of healthy lifestyles for citizens?,
 - Use case 3 ?Early Warning System (EWS) and Cardiovascular Accidents detection?.
 - Fulfil the eHealth Ageing Well related requirements provided in ETSI TR 103 509, mainly the ontological ones that were mostly taken as input for the ontology specification.

SAREF4EHAW mainly reuses the following existing ontologies: SAREF, ETSI SmartBAN reference model, SAREF 4 Environment extension and W3C SSN System module. The following figure presents the high level view of SAREF4EHAW ontology.
![SAREF4SYST overview](diagrams/SAREF4EHAW_Model.jpg)
For semantic interoperability handling purposes, an ontology based solution, combined with sensing-as-a-service and WoT strategies, is retained for SAREF4EHAW. Therefore, an upper level ontology, at service level, shall also behas been fully modelled (Service class and sub-classes depicted in the previous figure).
For embedded semantic analytics purposes, SAREF4EHAW shall behas been designed using the modularity principle (see ETSI TR 103 509) and can thus be mainly described by the following self-contained knowledge sub-ontologies (or modules): HealthActor, Ban, HealthDevice, Function (measured data related concepts included) and Service.",https://saref.etsi.org/saref4ehaw/,,,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,70,https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/s4ehaw

SAREF4INMA (Industry and Manufacturing) Extension,s4inma,"['IoT', 'Industry']","SAREF4INMA is an extension of SAREF for the industry and manufacturing domain. SAREF4INMA focuses on extending SAREF for the industry and manufacturing domain to solve the lack of interoperability between various types of production equipment that produce items in a factory and, once outside the factory, between different organizations in the value chain to uniquely track back the produced items to the corresponding production equipment, batches, material and precise time in which they were manufactured. SAREF4INMA is specified and published by ETSI in the TS 103 410-5 associated to this ontology file. SAREF4INMA was created to be aligned with related initiatives in the smart industry and manufacturing domain in terms of modelling and standardization, such as the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI), which combines several standards used by the various national initiatives in Europe that support digitalization in manufacturing. The full list of use cases, standards and requirements that guided the creation of SAREF4INMA are described in the associated ETSI TR 103 507.",https://saref.etsi.org/saref4inma/,,,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,75,https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/s4inma
SAREF4SYST (Systems) Extension,s4syst,['IoT'],"The present document is the technical specification of SAREF4SYST, a generic extension of [ETSI TS 103 264 SAREF](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/02.01.01_60/ts_103264v020101p.pdf) that defines an ontology pattern which can be instantiated for different domains. SAREF4SYST defines Systems, Connections between systems, and Connection Points at which systems may be connected. These core concepts can be used generically to define the topology of features of interest, and can be specialized for multiple domains. The topology of features of interest is highly important in many use cases. If a room holds a lighting device, and if it is adjacent with an open window to a room whose luminosity is low, then by turning on the lighting device in the former room one may expect that the luminosity in the latter room will rise.

The SAREF4SYST ontology pattern can be instantiated for different domains. For example to describe zones inside a building (systems), that share a frontier (connections). Properties of systems are typically state variables (e.g. agent population, temperature), whereas properties of connections are typically flows (e.g. heat flow).

SAREF4SYST has two main aims: on the one hand, to extend SAREF with the capability or representing general topology of systems and how they are connected or interact and, on the other hand, to exemplify how ontology patterns may help to ensure an homogeneous structure of the overall SAREF ontology and speed up the development of extensions.

SAREF4SYST consists both of a core ontology, and guidelines to create ontologies following the SAREF4SYST ontology pattern. The core ontology is a lightweight OWL-DL ontology that defines 3 classes and 9 object properties.

Use cases for ontology patterns are described extensively in  [ETSI TR 103 549 Clauses 4.2 and 4.3](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/103500_103599/103549/01.01.01_60/tr_103549v010101p.pdf).

For the Smart Energy domain:

- Electric power systems can exchange electricity with other electric power systems. The electric energy can flow both ways in some cases (from the Public Grid to a Prosumer), or in only one way (from the Public Grid to a Load). Electric power systems can be made up of different sub-systems. Generic sub-types of electric power systems include producers, consumers, storage systems, transmission systems. 
- Electric power systems may be connected one to another through electrical connection points. An Electric power system may have multiple connection points (Multiple Winding Transformer generally have one single primary winding with two or more secondary windings). Generic sub-types of electrical connection points include plugs, sockets, direct-current, single-phase, three-phase, connection points. 
- An Electrical connection may exist between two Electric power systems at two of their respective connection points. Generic sub-types of electrical connections include Single-phase Buses, Three-phase Buses. A single-phase electric power system can be connected using different configurations at a three-phase bus (RN, SN, TN types).

For the Smart Building domain:

- Buildings, Storeys, Spaces, are different sub-types of Zones. Zones can contain sub-zones. Zones can be adjacent or intersect with other zones. 
- Two zones may share one or more connections. For example some fresh air may be created inside a storey if it has two controllable openings to the exterior at different cardinal points. 

A graphical overview of the SAREF4SYST ontology is provided in Figure 1. In such figure:

- Rectangles are used to denote Classes. The label of the rectangle is the identifier of the Class.
- Plain arrows are used to represent Object Properties between Classes. The label of the arrow is the identifier of the Object Property. The origin of the arrow is the domain Class of the property, and the target of the arrow is the range Class of the property.
- Dashed arrows with identifiers between stereotype signs (i.e. ""`<< >>`"") refer to OWL axioms that are applied to some property. Four pairs of properties are inverse one of the other; the property `s4syst:connectedTo` is symmetric, and properties `s4syst:hasSubSystem` and `s4syst:hasSubSystem` are transitive.
- A symbol =1 near the target of an arrow denotes that the associated property is functional. A symbol ? denotes a local existential restriction.

The typical work products in the software processes are often documents or source code and they are managed from specialized or generic tools. For example, software modeling tools such as Rational Rose, or version control systems such as Git are examples of specialized tools that provide support to the management of certain types of work products. However, other generic tools such as content management systems, document management systems and collaborative editing systems or wikis can also be used to manage evidences of the processes. The design of models for certain types of work products has been an approach used in model-driven web methodologies. However, it is common the need for adapting and customizing well-known methodologies for their application in concrete situations and in specific organizations, a.k.a. process tailoring. Therefore, a vocabulary to define flexible work products in terms of structure and type of its artifacts is proposed here.",http://spi-fm.uca.es/spdef/models/deployment/swpm/1.0,,,Not Specified,55,https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/swpm

Tempo Ontology,tempo,['Time'],"In a typical (uni)temporal data model every resource's appearance (and disappearance) is being tracked.
Numerous systems accomplish unitemporal tracking, either externally by e.g. using git to record the insertion or deletion of a resource, or internally by e.g. using prov:generatedAtTime and prov:invalidatedAtTime.
This axis of time is known as *system time*, and none of TempO's concern because for one there is readily available support, and moreover because unitemporal tracking is used for principally true statements, i.e. those that have always been (considered) true or will always be (considered) true.

TempO addresses bitemporal and tritemporal setups: Resources which are (known or believed to be) valid and efficacious for some time.
A second time axis orthogonal to system time is introduced, that is a resource can be valid even though it is currently not in the system, or, conversely, can be already or still invalid by the time it enters the system.

Efficacy, sometimes called decision time, is yet another concept orthogonal to validity, i.e. a resource that is no longer or not yet valid can be efficacious.
The converse, a valid but inefficacious resource in the system, is *usually* not encountered but TempO does not impose restrictions on the shape of the time area.

In general the necessity for tracking both validity and efficacy arises in areas where concepts are assigned a code or label that is subject to reuse following invalidation.
Tracking efficacy and validity concurrently then allows for fine-grained control over how much future knowledge or how much past knowledge we tolerate in a datset.

Example:
--------
Czechoslovakia was founded in 1918 but became part of Germany, Hungary and Poland in 1938.
It was reestablished in 1945 but split into two sovereign states in 1993.
The ISO 3166 country code for Czechoslovakia used to be 'CS', assigned in 1974, published in February 1978, and invalidated with the country's split.
In 2003 ISO 3166 reassigned the country code 'CS' to Serbia and Montenegro.
The facts were assembled in 2018 and written down as follows:

    cc:CSHH
        a cc:ISO3166-CountryCode ;
        rdfs:label ""CS"" ;
        cc:refersTo ""Czechoslovakia"" ;
        prov:generatedAtTime ""2018-02-29T04:00:00Z""^^xsd:dateTime .
        tempo:validFrom ""1978-02""^^xsd:gYearMonth ;
        tempo:validTill ""1993-01-01""^^xsd:date ;
        tempo:efficaciousFrom ""1918""^^xsd:gYear , ""1945""^^xsd:gYear ;
        tempo:efficaciousTill ""1938""^^xsd:gYear , ""2003""^^xsd:gYear .

The use of the country code 'CS' in a statement from 1988 can be resolved to cc:CSHH, as of today, free from ambiguity; it was valid back then after all and we know that today.
The same query in 2017 (point-in-time query) would have yielded no results because the information hadn't been in the system back then.
Point-in-time queries, however, are not TempO's major concern so only as-of-today queries are assumed from now on.

Following the country's split it is highly likely that news reports from, say, 1994 highlighting the then-recent past would still have used 'CS' to refer to cc:CSHH.
According to the resource this is possible, a query for 'CS' in 1994 would bring up cc:CSHH as it is efficacious but marked as invalidated.

On the other end of history, the use of the code 'CS' in, say, 1976 is plausible.  The code was decided on but not yet formally published.
A query for 'CS' as used in 1976 would bring up cc:CSHH, marked as anachronistic.
Going back further, a statement from, say 1942, using the code 'CS' must clearly refer to something else.
A query for 'CS' as used in 1976 would yield not yield any results.

VIR (Vaccination Information Representation) Ontology,vir,['Multimedia'],"This ontology, called VIR, is an extension of CIDOC-CRM created to sustain propositions on the nature of visual elements and permit these descriptions to be published on the Web.
With the term visual element, we refer to those signs identified in the visual space as distinct and documentable units, and subject to an analytical interpretation.
The scope of this ontology is to s to provide a framework to support the identification, annotation and interconnections between diverse visual elements and presents and assist their documentation and retrieval. Specifically, the model aims to clarify the identity and the relation of these visual signs, providing the necessary classes to characterise their constituent elements, reference, symbolic content and source of interpretation.
VIR expands on key entities and properties from CIDOC-CRM, introducing new classes and relationships responding to the visual and art historical community, specifically building up on the iconographical tradition. The result is a model which differentiates between interpretation and element identified, providing a clear distinction between denotation and signification of an element. As a consequence of such distinction, the ontology allows for the definition of diverse denotative criteria for the same representation, which could change based on traditions and perspective. Visual objects can be, in fact, polysemic and ambiguous, and it is not so easy to pin down a denotative or connotative meaning because they are very much context-dependent.",http://w3id.org/vir#,,,Not Specified,55,https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/vocabs/vir
