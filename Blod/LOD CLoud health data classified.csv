OBOE,bioportal-oboe,biomedicine; bioportal; format-owl; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,"        The Extensible Observation Ontology (OBOE) is a formal ontology for capturing the semantics of scientific observation and measurement. The ontology supports researchers to add detailed semantic annotations to scientific data, thereby clarifying the inherent meaning of scientific observations. The main concepts in OBOE include: - Observation: an event in which one or more measurements are taken - Measurement: the measured value of a property for a specific object or phenomenon (e.g., 3.2) - Entity: an object or phenomenon on which measurements are made (e.g., Quercus rubrum) - Characteristic: the property being measured (e.g., VolumetricDensity) - Standard: units and controlled vocabularies for interpreting measured values (e.g., g/cm^3) - Protocol: the procedures followed to obtain measurements (e.g., DensityProtocol2014) OBOE can characterize the context of an observation (e.g., space and time), as well as dependencies such as nested experimental observations. It includes an extensive set of unit definitions (e.g., grams of carbon per liter of seawater), and can facilitate automatic unit conversions (e.g., pounds to kilograms). OBOE can be easily extended to create Entities and Characteristics for specific research domains, making it both broadly applicable and highly customizable. OBOE is being used to improve data interpretation, facilitate reuse, and create precise and effective systems for data search and discovery.",https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/bioportal-oboe,Biomathematics
SNP-Ontology,bioportal-snpo,biomedicine; bioportal; format-owl; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,SNP-Ontology is a domain ontology that provides a formal representation (OWL-DL) of genomic variations.

"Transcription profiling of human, chimp and mouse brain",arrayexpress-e-afmx-1,format-efo; format-pobo; format-prov; lifesciences; lod; no-proprietary-vocab; provenance-metadata; published-by-third-party,Microarray technologies allow the identification of large numbers of expression differences within and between species. Although environmental and physiological stimuli are clearly responsible for changes in the expression levels of many genes  it is not known whether the majority of changes of gene expression fixed during evolution between species and between various tissues within a species are caused by Darwinian selection or by stochastic processes. We find the following: (1) expression differences between species accumulate approximately linearly with time; (2) gene expression variation among individuals within a species correlates positively with expression divergence between species; (3) rates of expression divergence between species do not differ significantly between intact genes and expressed pseudogenes; (4) expression differences between brain regions within a species have accumulated approximately linearly with time since these regions emerged during evolution. These results suggest that the majority of expression differences observed between species are selectively neutral or nearly neutral and likely to be of little or no functional significance. Therefore  the identification of gene expression differences between species fixed by selection should be based on null hypotheses assuming functional neutrality. Furthermore  it may be possible to apply a molecular clock based on expression differences to infer the evolutionary history of tissues.,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/arrayexpress-e-afmx-1,Genetics

Pathway ontology,bioportal-pw,biomedicine; bioportal; format-obo; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,The goal of the Pathway Ontology is to capture the various kinds of biological networks  the relationships between them and the alterations or malfunctioning of such networks within a hierarchical structure. The five nodes are: classic metabolic pathways  regulatory pathways  signaling pathways  drug pathways and disease pathways for complex human conditions. KEGG and Reactome databases  as well as extensive literature searches have been used to choose terms and their position within the tree. A complex human disease pathway is viewed in the context of genetic and environmental attributes that can affect or impair the functioning of various molecular and cellular pathways; their combined  accumulated effect is manifested in the diseased phenotype. In many cases the identity of the malfunctioning dynamic entity is speculated rather than known. Metabolic  regulatory or signaling pathway terms have associated terms for the altered version of the pathway and the level at which the alteration(s) may occur. Proteins with mutations known to affect a particular pathway can be annotated to the normal and altered version(s) of the pathway and to a disease pathway  if known. The ontology provides a unified way to annotate gene products to any type of pathway as well as to deviant pathways. Its hierarchical structure offers the researcher a 'view' of the connections  if not the dependencies between individual pathways  of the possible link between alterations within these complex biological circuitries and diseases.,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/bioportal-pw,Medical Sciences

Gene Regulation Ontology,bioportal-bootstrep,biomedicine; bioportal; format-owl; format-rdf; lod; ontology; published-by-third-party,The BOOTStrep Ontology is a conceptual model for the domain of gene regulation.

GRO is intended to represent common knowledge about gene regulation in a formal way rather than representing extremely fine-grained classes as can be found in ontologies such as the Gene Ontology (GO) (created for data base annotation purposes) and various relevant databases. The main purpose of the ontology is to support NLP applications. It has a particular focus on the relations between processes and the molecules (participants) involved. The basic structure of the GRO is a direct acyclic graph (DAG) with ontology classes as nodes and is-a relations between classes as edges. The taxonomic backbone is further enriched by several semantic relation types (part-of  from-species  participates-in with the two sub-relations agent-of and patient-of).,https://lod-cloud.net/dataset/bioportal-bootstrep,genetics/Bioinformatics
